# SirhoodApps

This project is for my bachelor's degree diploma and it is about an online shop.

I wanted to make an online shop because I don't see a lot of male products shops around the web for Romania.

The ideea of "*Sirhood*" came into my mind after thinking about the word "*manhood*" which represents the little boy becoming a man, so I thought that "*sirhood*" will represent the man becoming a "*sir*" or a "*gentleman*". This shop will mainly have products for males but there are also products for females because "*Behind every strong man stands a powerful woman!*"

The main project contains 3 applications:

- Server app - made in Node.js with Express and MongoDB, it serves as the back-end of the other 2 applications
- Inventory app - made in Angular 10, will be used as administration page for the main app. Can be used for things like adding new items to the store or modify the existing ones
- Sirhood app - made in Angular 11, is the main online shop application.
